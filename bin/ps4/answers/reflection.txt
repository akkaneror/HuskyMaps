problem 1 = 8 hours
problem 2 = 12 hours
problem 3 = 8 hours


b.
I focused too much on perfecting my data representation in NumberSet.  I should have just gone with a "good enough" approach, because the alternative means thinking much much much too hard about optimization.

Additionally, focued pretty heavily on creating quality test code for cases that turned out to be implementation-based rather than specification-based (a.k.a. worthless in terms of credit on the assignment, but i suppose good piece of mind (for what I have left) )


c.
I don't know if the staff COULD have done anything better.  That method of cross-checking rankings is pretty interesting.  I think another lecture on how to test code would be pretty neat, especially on the deep majicks that allow people to mutate so-called immutable objects


d.
I wish I had stuck to a single representation for NumberSet and moved on in a sane manner.  This would have left more time to write test cases.
