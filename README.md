HuskyMaps
=========

A Google-Maps-like java application to find shortest-path street directions from one address to another.

Powered by Dijkstra's Algorithm with a heavily modified A*  heuristic.

The data sets are stored in tigerdb/ and contain geographic data over all of washington state (though you could download your own Tiger datasets).
