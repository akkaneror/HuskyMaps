I collaborated with students wuite a bit.

Jared and Chris as well as others.  Mostly, collaboration was lab time together, where if one person had an issue, they would seek the input of another.  Usually the combined brain power and new perspective was enough to get things moving again.  Often times, there was a bit of a gap in completeness.  At these times, one person would sit at length with another.

Such collabartion made this homework immeasuarbly more enjoyable and valuble as an expereience.
